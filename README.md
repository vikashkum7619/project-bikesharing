# project-bikesharing
 Bike sharing
In this project,  make a neural network to solve a prediction problem in a real dataset! By building a neural network from scratch, we  will understand much better how gradient descent, backpropagation, and other important concepts of neural networks work. 
The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database link (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
